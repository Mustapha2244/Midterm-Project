Progress Reflec@on
ABer conducCng the demo, I have reflected on the iniCal objecCves set for the project. While significant progress has been made, I have reassessed the project goals and schedule.
1. Accomplishment of Objec@ves: I believe that I will be able to accomplish the majority of the iniCal objecCves by the end of the semester, although some may require adjustment
based on current progress.
2. Schedule Status: I am currently on track with the project Cmeline, but I recognize the importance of remaining flexible to adapt to any unforeseen challenges.
3. Func@onality Adjustments: While I iniCally aimed to implement several features, I am considering scaling down or simplifying some funcCons to ensure the core funcConaliCes are robust and user-friendly.
4. Use Case Re-evalua@on: I will prioriCze essenCal use cases that directly contribute to the user experience and business goals. Non-essenCal use cases may be deferred or canceled.
5. Future Enhancements: If the current development progresses smoothly, I will explore the addiCon of more interesCng features that enhance user engagement and system funcConality.
